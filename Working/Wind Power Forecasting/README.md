# Wind Power Forecasting

## About the Dataset

### Context
This dataset pertains to a specific windmill, with the objective of predicting the wind power that could be generated over the next 15 days. A long-term wind forecasting technique is thus required to achieve accurate predictions.

### Content
The dataset includes various features related to weather conditions, turbine specifications, and rotor characteristics. Data has been collected from January 2018 to March 2020, with readings recorded at a 10-minute interval. 

### Features
- **Weather Features:** Temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, etc.
- **Turbine Features:** Turbine model, operational status, maintenance records, etc.
- **Rotor Features:** Rotor diameter, height, and other relevant specifications.
