# Student Performance Predictions

## Overview
This project uses a student performance dataset to evaluate and predict academic outcomes based on various factors that influence student success. The goal is to understand how these factors correlate with students' final grades and to build a predictive model that can forecast student performance.

## Motivation
The motivation for this project arose from the interest in identifying which factors impact students' academic performance. Understanding these relationships can help educators identify students who may need additional support to improve their outcomes.

## Dataset Features
The dataset includes the following features:
- **StudentID**: A unique identifier for each student.
- **Name**: The name of the student.
- **Gender**: The gender of the student (Male/Female).
- **AttendanceRate**: The percentage of classes attended by the student.
- **StudyHoursPerWeek**: The number of hours the student studies per week.
- **PreviousGrade**: The grade the student received in the previous semester (from 0 to 100).
- **ExtracurricularActivities**: The number of extracurricular activities the student is involved in.
- **ParentalSupport**: A qualitative assessment of the level of support provided by the student's parents (High/Medium/Low).
- **FinalGrade**: The student's final grade (from 0 to 100), which serves as the target variable for prediction.

## Use Cases
- **Student Performance Prediction**: Build machine learning models to predict students' final grades based on other features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Explore the relationships between different factors (such as attendance or study habits) and academic performance.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Examine which characteristics are most predictive of academic success, providing insights into key areas for educational interventions.
- **Educational Interventions**: Identify patterns in the data to implement targeted interventions that help students improve in specific areas.

## Potential Insights
- **Correlation between Study Habits and Performance**: Determine how study time contributes to academic success.
- **Impact of Attendance on Grades**: Analyze the extent to which regular attendance influences final grades.
- **Role of Extracurricular Activities**: Assess whether participation in extracurricular activities positively or negatively impacts academic performance.
- **Influence of Parental Support**: Examine how different levels of parental support affect student outcomes.

## Conclusion
The student performance dataset is a versatile tool for educators, data scientists, and researchers interested in understanding and predicting academic success. By analyzing this data, stakeholders can gain valuable insights into the factors contributing to academic performance and develop strategies to improve educational outcomes.

## Technical Aspects
In this project, I used the following technologies and tools:
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Data**: The dataset was collected from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/haseebindata/student-performance-predictions].

## To Do
Here are some improvements and features I plan to implement in the future:
- Add more analyses or visualizations.
- Implement a predictive model.
- Improve the documentation.
