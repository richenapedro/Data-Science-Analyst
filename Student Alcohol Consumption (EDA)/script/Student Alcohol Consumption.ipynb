It is also noteworthy that the level of alcohol consumption during the week is concentrated in the ranges of 1 and 2, which indicates low or negligible alcohol consumption. Since the index does not present a value for individuals who do not consume alcohol, we can presume that a considerable portion of the individuals marked with a consumption level of 1 are likely non-drinkers."

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, various characteristics of students were examined in relation to their influence on grades. Below are the main considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The majority of the analyzed students are adolescents, with ages ranging from 15 to 18 years, although there are some older students.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It was observed that during the week, most students choose not to consume alcohol, with a small portion consuming only minimal amounts and an even smaller number reporting high consumption. However, this trend changes on weekends, where a significant proportion of students report some level of alcohol consumption, ranging from moderate to high.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The students' grades exhibit a distribution resembling a normal pattern, demonstrating a strong correlation between the grades obtained in different periods and the final grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Furthermore, the analysis revealed that male students tend to consume more alcohol than female students. It was also noted that with increasing age, alcohol consumption on weekends tends to rise, peaking during adolescence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It was observed that some students tend to drop out of the course after receiving their grades from the first exam. Notably, there was a significant dropout rate in the Mathematics course at GP School compared to another school. In contrast, both schools exhibited a much lower and nearly equal dropout rate in the Portuguese subject. This discrepancy in dropout rates highlights the challenges faced by students in Mathematics, suggesting that additional support and resources may be necessary to enhance student retention in this subject. Addressing the factors contributing to these dropouts could be crucial for improving overall academic performance and ensuring that students remain engaged in their studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, the age and gender of the students do not appear to have a significant impact on their grades. However, alcohol consumption demonstrated an inversely proportional relationship with grades: those who consume alcohol in larger quantities tend to have lower academic performance."
