# Stroke Prediction

## Project Description
This project analyzes a dataset containing clinical and demographic information to explore the factors influencing the likelihood of a stroke occurrence. The goal is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and potentially predict the probability of a stroke based on various attributes such as age, gender, health conditions, and lifestyle choices.

## About the Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

- **id**: Unique identifier for each patient.
- **gender**: Patient's gender (binary: 'Male', 'Female', or 'Other').
- **age**: Age of the patient (numeric).
- **hypertension**: Indicator (0 or 1) of whether the patient has hypertension.
- **heart_disease**: Indicator (0 or 1) of whether the patient has heart disease.
- **ever_married**: Indicates if the patient has ever been married (binary: 'No' or 'Yes').
- **work_type**: Type of work the patient is engaged in (nominal: 'children', 'Govt_job', 'Never_worked', 'Private', or 'Self-employed').
- **Residence_type**: Type of residence (binary: 'Rural' or 'Urban').
- **avg_glucose_level**: Average glucose level in the blood (numeric).
- **bmi**: Body Mass Index (numeric).
- **smoking_status**: Status of smoking (nominal: 'formerly smoked', 'never smoked', 'smokes', or 'Unknown').
- **stroke**: Indicator (1 if the patient had a stroke, 0 if not).

## Potential Data Analysis and Data Science Techniques

### Descriptive Statistics
- Calculate summary statistics for numerical columns (mean, median, min, max of age, glucose level, BMI).
- Count frequencies for categorical columns (how many patients are hypertensive, have heart disease, etc.).

### Risk Factor Analysis
- Examine the distribution of risk factors (hypertension, heart disease, smoking status).
- Correlate age and other risk factors with stroke occurrence.

### Predictive Modeling
- **Stroke Prediction**: Use classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to predict the likelihood of stroke based on attributes like age, gender, and health conditions.

### Recommendation Systems
- Build recommendation systems for preventive measures based on patient profiles.

### Visualizations
- **Histograms and Bar Charts**: To visualize the distribution of age, glucose levels, and BMI.
- **Box Plots**: To compare risk factors across different groups.
- **Scatter Plots**: To visualize relationships between numerical variables (e.g., age vs. average glucose level).
- **Heatmaps**: To show correlations between different attributes.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handle missing values (e.g., impute, remove).
- Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.
- Normalize or scale numerical features if necessary for certain algorithms.

## Advanced Techniques
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features from existing data (e.g., age groups, BMI categories).
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use PCA or other techniques if the dataset has high dimensionality.

These analyses and techniques will help uncover valuable insights, optimize preventive strategies, improve patient outcomes, and ultimately drive healthcare effectiveness.
